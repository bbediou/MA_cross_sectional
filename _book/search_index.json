This meta-analysis covers 2000-2020. It thus overlaps partially with the meta-analysis by Bediou et al. 2018 and extends it by 5 years. 2.1 Overview of our first meta-analysis (Bediou et al., 2018) The literature review from our former meta-analysis (Bediou et al., 2018) covered the period between January 2000 and December 2015. A total of 5,770 abstracts were identified, from which 630 full texts were dimmed eligible. Only 82 manuscripts passed our inclusion/exclusion criteria, comprising 65 published and 17 unpublished studies. The cross-sectional meta-analysis by Bediou et al. (2018) included 194 effects extracted from 89 experiments drawn from 73 distinct manuscripts. 2.2 The present dataset For the present meta-analysis, the search keywords were identical. However, our selection criteria were slightly different which could result in differences in terms of inclusion or exclusion. Therefore, all 5,770 abstracts that had been identified by our initial search were re-assessed again for eligibility by three independent reviewers. In addition, a new literature search was conducted covering the period January 2015 - June 2020. With this new search an additional 3,497 abstracts were identified (after removal of duplicates). Reading of the abstracts led to 506 exclusions leaving 243 additional new full texts to assess. TO CHECK From these combined searches, a total of 105 cross-sectional studies were found in 73 manuscripts. The table below indicates the number of studies, effects and min/max/median number of effect sizes extracted per study. Studies with unbalanced gender ratios were discarded from analysis. In the next section, Chapter 3, we first review the raw dataset, and then the filtered dataset which was used for all analyses. TO CHECK The final dataset includes 224 effect sizes extracted from 105 studies found in 76 manuscripts (??X published??)

There is a predominance of males in both AVGPs and NVGPs. The green and orange dashed lines define 3 regions on the between-group difference in the proportion of males: - The upper left region (above green) contains studies with greater proportion of males in NVGPs - The bottom right corner (below orange) contains studies with more males in AVGPs - Between these two lines are studies with less than 25% difference in gender ratio There is a bias toward having more males in the AVGP group. Therefore, only studies with a difference in gender ratio less than 25% will be included in subsequent plots and analyses These studies are shown with a green contour When the difference exceeded 20%, authors were contacted in order to obtain data from male-only samples, only if a minimum of 10 participants in each group. excluded studies Studies excluded at the data extraction stage for various reasons: gender imbalance, criteria for defining AVGP or NVGPs, etc. # effect sizes per paper - excluded studies only studies effects 36 59 3.2 Filtered dataset (i.e., matched gender) Effect sizes as well subject and study characteristics were then extracted from all studies that were eligible.

Let me know if we should chat about these points! This can be important given that: - the same data has sometimes been published across several manuscripts - and some manuscripts contains different subject samples. 5.1 Overall estimate We use a multilevel meta-analytic model with robust variance estimates (RVE) for correlated and hierarchical effects (CHE) with small sample correction. The default correlation is set to 0.8 (default in RVE), and we use sensitivity analyses (see below) to test the impact of different values. The model includes a random factor for Papers and one for each effect sizes nested in papers. 5.1.1 Multilevel model (without RVE) ## ## Multivariate Meta-Analysis Model (k = 222; method: REML) ## ## Variance Components: ## ## estim sqrt nlvls fixed factor ## sigma^2.1 0.0271 0.1645 73 no Paper ## sigma^2.2 0.1119 0.3346 222 no Paper/ES_ID ## ## Test for Heterogeneity: ## Q(df = 221) = 959.6214, p-val &lt; .0001 ## ## Model Results: ## ## estimate se tval df pval ci.lb ci.ub ## 0.6375 0.0521 12.2436 221 &lt;.0001 0.5349 0.7402 *** ## ## --- ## Signif. codes: 0 &#39;***&#39; 0.001 &#39;**&#39; 0.01 &#39;*&#39; 0.05 &#39;.&#39; 0.1 &#39; &#39; 1 Note that this model reports model-based (not robust) standard errors.

We pre-registered the CHE model as our primary model; other models are presented to show sensitivity of our results to various meta-analytic models. 5.2 Moderator analysis Moderator analysis is based on the multilevel model (i.e. mlma WITHOUT RVE) because the Wald_test is not compatible with the CHE model (i.e., mlma with RVE)… Our model includes moderators: - Cognitive domain (9 levels) - DV type: speed, accuracy (should we relabel as performance measure_ ?) - Effect: main (e.g., overall performance), interaction (e.g., difference score) - Recruitment: overt, covert 5.2.1 Compare RVE, CHE and SCE models Notes: - RVE = Robust Variance Estimate (effect sizes clustered by paper, correlated weights) - CHE = Correlated Hierarchical Weights (random effects multilevel model with RVE) - SCE = Subgroup Correlated Effects (alternative to running meta-analyses for each subgroup) =&gt; SCE RANDOM EFFECTS TO BE CHECKED BY MELISSA ! This analysis focuses on cognitive domain (primary moderator) and controls for other (secondary) moderators. The magnitude of the obtained estimates depends on the choice of reference levels for secondary moderators. The Wald Test of moderator effects test the relative differences between levels and is thus not sensitive to reference levels. However, to test if individual estimate differs from zero, we need to correct each estimate using the relative frequency of each moderator level in the dataset.

None of the moderators showed significant moderating influence according to AHT-F test (using clubSandwich::Wald_test) on the multilevel model (i.e., without RVE) except a marginal effect of recruitment. AVGPs outperformed NVGPs in irrespective of cognitive domain, DV type, effect or recruitment method: Cognitive domain: stronger effects for perception and multitasking, followed by top-down attention, spatial cognition and inhibition, and then verbal cognition. Marginal effect for problem solving and unreliable estimates (low df) for motor control and bottom-up attention. DV type: significant effects on speed and accuracy. Effect: significant group differences for both overall (main effect) performance measures and difference scores (interactions). Significant effect in both overtly and covertly recruited participants, with numerically larger effect for overt vs. covert. Residual heterogeneity is still significant (QE(210) = 870.1, p = ), suggesting additional moderating variables may be involved ! =&gt; Additional analyses are needed to understand where this comes from: publication bias / small study effect (adding variance or sda to moderator models?) lab / joint publication group single moderator models 5.3 Publication bias Numerous techniques exist for detecting and correcting publication bias. While methods for detecting publication bias (or small study effects) have improved largely over the past decades, it is not the case of correction methods such that estimating a unbiased (or publication-bias-corrected) estimate remains a challenge. The numerous methods available to date provide very heterogeneous estimates and will thus be reported in the form of sensitivity analysis as as recently recommended by Mathur &amp; VanderWeele (2020). Detection of publication bias was done for both: - The overall effect (intercept only model) and - The full model including all moderators Our main publication bias detection approach is based on Egger’s regression test with a modified precision covariate (Pustejovsky &amp; Rodgers, 2019). In addition, we use a number of additional methods to estimate the adjusted effect, because the estimates obtained from Eggers’s test (and PET-PEESE) are known to be unreliable. The best method for estimating the publication bias (or small-study) adjusted effect is based on the 3-parameter model selection (see below). 5.3.1 (contour-enhanced) Funnel plots Funnel plots are based on multilevel models without RVE, first for overall effect (i.e., intercept only) and then for the full model (i.e., with all moderators). In order to use trim and fill, we also conducted a univariate model using one randomly sampled estimate from each cluster. 5.3.2 Significance funnel plot (Mathur &amp; VanderWeele, 2020) This new type of graphical illustration was introduced recently as an alternative to funnel plots. Note: the line was drawn manually (i.e., no classification applied) with intercept = 0 and slope = 0.52. Non-affirmative studies have smaller point estimates than affirmative studies, suggesting that results may be sensitive to publication bias. 5.3.3 Egger’s regression with modified precision covariate This method is based on work from Pustejovsky and Rodgers (2018), and Rodgers &amp; Pustejovsky (2020). The new (Egger’s sandwich) test has been shown to maintain type I error (unlike the inflated type I errors commonly reported with other methods). Quote from Pustejovsky &amp; Rodgers 2020, page 36: “the Egger Sandwich is an acceptable, valid test for meta-analysis, but it must be interpreted with caution both because it has limited power to detect funnel plot asymmetry and because, in practice, such asymmetry may have other causes besides selective reporting.” “The Funnel Plot Test with MLMA maintains Type I error across nearly all conditions, and like the Egger Sandwich, it lacks power to detect funnel plot asymmetry.” We ran both Egger’s Sandwich and Egger’s MLMA models on both overall effect (intercept only) and full model with all moderators. method model term b se t dfs p ci.lb ci.ub Coef df_Satt Egger CHE (MLMA + RVE) NULL intrcpt -0.039 0.183 -0.212 13.4 0.835 -0.434 0.356 intrcpt 13.4 sda 1.917 0.538 3.567 18.4 0.002 0.790 3.045 sda 18.4 FULL intrcpt -0.008 0.199 -0.042 19.4 0.967 -0.424 0.407 intrcpt 19.4 sda 1.804 0.639 2.824 22.1 0.010 0.480 3.128 sda 22.1 Egger Sandwich (RVE) NULL intrcpt -0.032 0.258 -0.124 12.0 0.903 -0.595 0.531 sda 2.088 0.729 2.865 14.9 0.012 0.533 3.643 FULL intrcpt 0.106 0.240 0.442 23.6 0.662 -0.389 0.601 sda 1.965 0.715 2.751 15.0 0.015 0.442 3.489 notes: - Terms: sda is the test of small-study effect; intercept is the corrected estimate - Models: NULL is the intercept-only model; FULL is the full moderator model Summary: The slope (sda) is significant indicating significant publication bias.

The other estimates can be ignored too as they are sensitive to choice of reference levels! Surprisingly, heterogeneity is still highly significant, even when including all moderators! =&gt; subgroup analyses? =&gt; moderators lab / joint publication group? =&gt; other suggestions…? 5.3.4 PET-PEESE Here, we applied PET and PEESE to our multilevel model with cluster robust variance (CHE model). For PEESE, we used the modified precision estimate because it increases precision. For comparison with Bediou et al., 2018, we also applied PET and PEESE to standard RVE models hierarchical weights and obtained similar results. In addition to the hierarchical weights used in Bediou et al. 2018, we also use correlated weights because they have been shown to perform significantly better in most situations. Again, we ran the analysis both on the overall effect (i.e., intercept only) model and on the full model with all moderators. Following Stanley &amp; Doucouliagos 2013, we use the conditional PET-PEESE estimate as follows: - If PET estimate is significant, we use PEESE estimate. - If PET is NS, then we use PET estimate. Note that this approach has been extensively criticized for its limitations, including by the authors themselves. Melissa recommended to drop PET-PEESE entirely because it is known to inflate type I error and has been consistently outperformed by the new precision estimate used by Egger Sandwich.

In order to run these analyses, we thus randomly picked one effect size per study (i.e. paper). To verify that this random sampling does not introduce bias, we first checked the distribution of the overall effect obtained from 1000 bootstrapped samples of one effect size per paper. The univariate meta-analysis of 73 randomly selected independent effect sizes revealed an average overall effect of mean g = 0.673 (SD = 0.027) ## term b se ci.lb ci.ub ## 1 intrcpt 0.501 0.0276 0.449 0.557 Across the 1000 bootstrapped samples, trim and fill analysis imputed between 12 and 21 additional effects on the left side of the funnel plot (median = 17), in order to correct for its asymmetry. These additional studies decreased the overall estimate to a mean of g = 0.501 (SD = 0.028), but did not alter significance all p’s &lt; .001). 5.3.5.2 P-Uniform (van Assen, van Aert &amp; Wicherts, 2015) p-uniform is fundamentally similar to a p-curve that estimates the true effect using only significant effects. This method is not without limitations; it tends to overestimate effect sizes when heterogeneity is moderate to large, and is insensitive to p-values that are close to significance, or in the presence of p-hacking (Van Aerts, Wicherts &amp; van Assen, 2016). ## term b se ci.lb ci.ub ## 1 intrcpt 0.713 0.0344 0.644 0.778 Studies with lower p values are observed less often than expected, whereas studies with high p values are more frequent than expected. Yet, the test of publication bias is not significant (pval = 1). 5.3.5.3 3-Parameter Selection Model (3PSM, Hedges &amp; Vevea 1996). Selection models are a general class of models that attempt to model the process by which the studies included in a meta-analysis may have been influenced by some form of publication bias. If a particular selection model is an adequate approximation for the underlying selection process, then the model provides estimates of the parameters of interest (e.g., the average true outcome and the amount of heterogeneity in the true outcomes) that are ‘corrected’ for this selection process (i.e., they are estimates of the parameters in the population of studies before any selection has taken place). PSM Using selmodel function from metafor This function allows to test different models. Colours show different (model-based) selective reporting biases: - Negexpm and logistic selection give identical results. - Step, halfnorm and Power give different results. 3-PSM Using weightfunc from weightr Here we focus on the 3-PSM approach, which models publication bias with 3-parameters. The first one represents how much less likely a non-significant result is to be published than a significant result. The other two parameters represent the estimated bias-adjusted mean effect and the estimated heterogeneity of the effects. Below we plot the distribution of estimates corrected for publication bias that are obtained from 100 bootstrapped samples with different thresholds for selective reporting ranging from 0.1 to 0.001. 5.3.6 Summary of publication-bias-corrected estimates method model term b se ci.lb ci.ub t dfs p pSignif PET (CHE) NULL intrcpt -0.485 0.203 -0.916 -0.055 -2.393 15.85 0.029 &lt;.05 FULL intrcpt -0.436 0.194 -0.840 -0.032 -2.246 20.48 0.036 &lt;.05 PET (RVE hier) NULL intrcpt -0.387 0.169 -0.798 0.023 -2.289 6.22 0.061 .

Across all analyses, the slope (tests of small-study effect / publication bias) was always significant. The unbiased or corrected (i.e. publication-bias free) estimates vary tremendously and are thus reported as a form of a sensitivity analysis.

I could focus on studies for which we obtained gender-matched data and compare with the original data reported in the paper with unmatched genders? However, because I contacted authors to ask for male-only data, I’d need to check how much data I am missing data to compute the original (gender unmatched) effects… 7.2 Subgroup analyses Adding with moderators and precision estimate to find the source of heterogeneity (and small-study effect). 7.3 Moderator Joint Publication Group Not sure how to do the clustering… We could parse the text and focus on surnames?

Follow-up analyses will examine whether those studies that were excluded appear to have a different ES distribution than those we kept. And I always think it’s nice to anticipate possible bad faith complaints (i.e., we excluded those studies on theoretical grounds, because those types of gender ratios make it impossible to separate gender effects from gaming effects; but it’s nice to be able to say that if we had kept them, it wouldn’t have made a difference empirically). 7.5 Task difficulty USE mean performance (%error, % correct, RT) as a measure of task difficulty to check impact on ES’s?
